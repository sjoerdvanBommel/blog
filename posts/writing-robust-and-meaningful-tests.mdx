title: Writing Robust and Meaningful Unit Tests
description: |
  It might be tempting to mock all dependencies when writing a unit test.
  But if you do, then is your test really validating the working of your code?
  And will it withstand some refactoring?
  Writing good unit tests is hard, but extremely valuable.
  Let's dive into some examples.

  import { codeToHtml } from 'shiki'

  const code = 'const a = 1' // input code
  const html = await codeToHtml(code, {
    lang: 'javascript',
    theme: 'vitesse-dark'
  })

  console.log(html) // highlighted html string
